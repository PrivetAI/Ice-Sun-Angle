## App Store Information

### Name
Ice Sun Angle

### Subtitle
Best Fishing Times by Sun

### Description
Find the perfect time for ice fishing based on sun position. The app calculates when sunlight shines directly into your fishing hole (bad for fishing) and when the sun is at a low angle (ideal conditions).

Features:
- Sun angle chart from sunrise to sunset
- Color-coded zones showing fishing quality
- "Golden windows" - optimal fishing time periods
- Compare multiple days for trip planning
- Three region presets for accurate calculations
- Works completely offline

When the sun is high, light penetrates the ice hole and fish can see your shadow. They become cautious and less likely to bite. Early morning and late afternoon provide the best conditions when the sun is low on the horizon.

Plan your ice fishing trips smarter with Ice Sun Angle.
