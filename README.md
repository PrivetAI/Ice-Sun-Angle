Find optimal ice fishing times using sun position

## Description
Fishing Sun Angle revolutionizes ice fishing strategy by leveraging the science of solar positioning. Based on proven fishing principles, this app calculates and displays the sun's angle throughout the day, helping you identify the "golden windows" when fish are most actively feeding.

**Key Features:**
- Visual sun angle graph with color-coded fishing zones
- Daily "golden window" recommendations for peak fishing times
- Compare multiple days to plan your best fishing trips
- Location-based calculations using GPS or manual input
- Historical date analysis to find optimal fishing periods
- Excellent, okay, and poor fishing time classifications
- Comprehensive help section explaining sun angle science
- Works completely offline - no data connection needed

**Why Sun Angle Matters:**
Fish behavior is significantly influenced by light penetration and sun position. Certain angles create optimal feeding conditions, especially during winter ice fishing when light dynamics are crucial.

**Perfect for:**
- Serious anglers looking for a competitive edge
- Planning multi-day ice fishing expeditions
- Understanding when fish are most active
- Maximizing limited fishing time

Let science guide your ice fishing success. Fishing Sun Angle turns astronomical data into actionable fishing intelligence.
